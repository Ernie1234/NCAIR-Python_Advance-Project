Code-to-Speech Developer Assistant

This Streamlit application takes a code snippet as input and uses the Google
Text-to-Speech (gTTS) library to convert the text into an audible voice.
The generated audio is then played back directly within the application,
allowing developers to listen to their code while multitasking.
